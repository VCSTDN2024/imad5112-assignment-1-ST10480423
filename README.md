2. Project Overview 
------------------- 
 
```markdown 
## Project overview (what’s the plan) 
 
The **[menu generator]** is a mobile App developed as part of an assignment in the [Higher certificate in mobile Application and web Development] subject. This App was created using the two programs Kotlin and android studio.  The app's primary purpose [The app was created for the user to input the time and generate the time food for the example, breakfast (then the different foods)]. 
 
 
Why?: 
---- 
-Provides a brief, Quick  and easy summary of the project. This helps anyone reading the document including your lecturer and potential future users, understand the app’s purpose quickly. 
-The app doesn't need that much understanding it's straightforward if you don't know what to eat, whatever time you put in, and the app generates a food choice you can decide to eat. 
 
 
3.  The Application Purpose and Features 
--------------------------- 
 
### Purpose: 
The main goal of this app is [To Generate a meal for whatever time you input and give you a food choice].  
 
### Key Features: 
-	Feature 1: [it use string numberers(for time)] 
-	Feature 2: [it doesn't give you one type of food it gives different types] 
 
These features aim to provide [for the string number it makes the person think out the box but at the same times it would give you a lot of options for meals]. 
``` 
 
Why: 
---- 
-	This section breaks down the specifics features and the purpose of the app  giving clarity on the apps functionality. 
--- functionality is that you put in the time and the app generators you a meal choose for that specific time 
 
4. Design  
------------------------ 
 

This design of the **[menu Generator]** was based on the following context : 
 
1.	**User Experience**: The app was made with the goal of providing an easier way for people to pick a meal they should eat instead of not knowing what to eat. 
    
2.	**Responsiveness**: This app was built to have well performance with the user and work with any screen. 
    
3.	**Simplicity**:  (the main screen is user-friendly). 
    
4.	**Performance**: The performance is good, and there is no lag, nor does the app crashes. 
 
 
Why: 
---- 
---the process of design it was how can I make it user friendly and be easy to use and came with the easy way  
 
5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization 
---------------------------------------- 

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity. 
 This project was managed by the use of GitHub for control, where it was committed to be pushed regularly, allowing us to keep track of maintained projects 
Why: 
---- 
- This section educates students on the importance of understanding version control (GitHub) and automation. It demonstrates how they are adopting industry-standard practices, which are beneficial for both academic purposes and career development. 
 
---just ensures code quality through automated testing and simplifies deployment 
 
6. Screen shots

*Caption for screenshot 1: [The home screen is just the main buttons and an edit text and a text view at the bottom to display the result."]* 
 
 
### Video showing of the base version:

Why: 
---- 
- Visuals like screenshots or a video link provide concrete evidence of the apps functionality This is an easy way for the reader to see what the app looks like and how it operates. 
 ---yes, it shows the code and the whole way of running the code  
 
7. Challenges 
--------------------------- 
 
## Challenges and Learnings 
 
During coding, I experienced  several challenges, including: 
 
1. **Challenge 1**:  [The challenge was trying to not make the app crash and when there a if different number entered and error must be displayer"] 
-	**Solution**: [I got help from King K's code on how to not let the app crash."]
