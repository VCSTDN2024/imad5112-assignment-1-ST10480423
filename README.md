2. Project Overview
-------------------

```markdown
## Project overview (what’s the plan)

The **[menu generator]** is a mobile App developed as part of an assignment in the [Higher certificate in mobile Application and web Development] subject. This App was created using the two programs **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to [The app was created for the user to input the time and generate the time food for the example, breakfast (then the different foods)].


Why:
----
- Provides a brief, Quick, and easy summary of the project. This helps anyone reading the document (including your lecturer and potential future) understand the app’s purpose quickly.

- The app doesn't need that much understanding it's straightforward if you don't know what to eat, whatever time you put in, and the app generates a food choice you can decide to eat.


3.  The Application Purpose and Features
---------------------------

```markdown
## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [Generate a meal for whatever time you input and give you a food choice]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [it use string numberers(for time)]
- Feature 2: [it doesn't give you one type of food it gives different types]

These features aim to provide [for the string number it makes the person think out the box but at the same times it would give you a lot of options for meals].
```

Why:
----
- This section breaks down the specific features and the purpose of the app, giving clarity on the app’s functionality.

--- functionality is that you put in the time and the app generators you a meal choose for that specific time

4. Design 
------------------------

## Design 

The design of the **[menu Generator]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an easier way for people to pick a meal they should eat instead of not knowing what to eat.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: This app was built to have well performance with the user and work with any screen.
   
3. **Simplicity**:  (the main screen is user-friendly).
   
4. **Performance**: The performance is good, and there is no lag, nor does the app crashes.


Why:
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices.
---the process of design it was how can I make it user friendly and be easy to use and came with the easy way 

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:

Why:
----
- This section educates students on why they should understand version control (GitHub) and automation. It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

---just ensures code quality through automated testing and simplifies deployment

6. Screenshots

*Caption for screenshot 1: [The home screen is just the main buttons and an edit text and a text view at the bottom to display the result."]*


### Video showing of the demo:
A video showcasing the app's functionality can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/P9x8PBE7esY].


Why:
----
- Visuals like screenshots or a video link provide concrete evidence of the app’s functionality. This is an easy way for the reader to see what the app looks like and how it operates.

---yes, it shows the code and the whole way of running the code 

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

## Challenges and Learnings

During coding, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**:  [The challenge was trying to not make the app crash and when there a if different number entered and error must be displayer"]
   - **Solution**: [I got help from King K's code on how to not let the app crash."]

Why:
----
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions shows growth and problem-solving skills, which are critical for students. It also gives insight into their learning process, which can be valuable to employers.

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------
## Further Enhancements

Why:
----
- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to continuously improve. It also demonstrates that the student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.
